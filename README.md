# Bird's Eye - A Simple Secure Micro Service for Querying Bird

A simple **secure** PHP micro service to provide some Bird protocol / routing information via a HTTP API as JSON *(with an optional built-in looking glass implementation)*.

This is the winning project from the [RIPE IXP Tools Hackaton](https://atlas.ripe.net/hackathon/ixp-tools/) just prior to [RIPE73](https://ripe73.ripe.net/) in Madrid, Spain. Since the hackathon, substanial improvements have been made.

## Live Examples

INEX runs a number of Bird instances and many of them have a public looking glass powered by Bird's Eye as a standlone live example and also integrated with with IXP Manager as a frontend consumer. 

* INEX Cork IPv4 Router Collector: https://www.inex.ie/rc1-cork-ipv4/
* INEX Cork IPv6 Router Collector: https://www.inex.ie/rc1-cork-ipv6/

The landing pages for the above also document the API calls available.

You can see the IXP Manager integration for ~30 Bird daemons at: https://www.inex.ie/ixp/lg

## Complementary Projects

At the hackathon, the team also produced comsumers of this API:

* https://github.com/dfkbg/birdseye - Python CLI consumer by Daniel Karrenberg
* https://github.com/ecix/birdseye - Python based web consumer by Matthias Hannig


## Rationale

Historically, IXPs made route collector and route server information available via looking glasses. Over the past few years, many IXPs have selected Bird as their route server / collector BGP daemon for a number of good reasons.

Bird is however lacking an API to allow IXPs to provide thise same looking glass type tools. More over, this also affects an IXP's ability to monitor these routing daemons and member sessions to them.

In a typical IXP, there will be six daemons per peering LAN:

 * two route servers and one route collector
 * a daemon per protocol

Having looked at existing Bird LG implementations, I could not identify one that met my requirements. Specifically:

1. One that could be bent to meet my requires in less time to (re)create this micro-service;
2. Fitted my skill set for such bending (primarily PHP);
3. Assured security.

## Security

As this is intended to be deployed on IXP's route servers / route collectors, security is vital. In that regard, I have made the following considerations:

* Natural rate limiting via caching by default. All queries are cached for a (configurable) period of at least one minute. This means the most you can hit the Bird daemon for a specific request is once / minute.
* Built in rate limiter for queries that take variable parameters (e.g. route lookup).
* Strict parameter parsing and checking.
* Bundled `birdc` bash script for safe use via sudo (web process will require this to access the Bird socket).
* `birdc` executed in *restricted* mode (allows show commands only).

This API was not designed with the notion of making it publically available. *It can be, but probably for route collectors rather than route servers in production.* Ideally it would be run on an internal private network and fronted by one of the looking glass frontends above that consume this API.

## Outlook

In an ideal world, this micro-service will be deprecated once the good folks who develop Bird release a version with a HTTP JSON API built in. This is a (hopefully) temporary solution to plug a gap.

## Installation

This is a basic [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) PHP application and the requirements are:

* PHP >= 5.5.9
* Mbstring PHP Extension

Download the release package and install on your server. E.g.:

```sh
# E.g. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
apt-get install php-cgi php-mbstring php-xml
# E.g. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
#Â apt-get install php5-cgi
cd /srv
wget https://github.com/inex/birdseye/releases/download/v1.0.3/birdseye-v1.0.3.tar.bz2
tar jxf birdseye-v1.0.3.tar.bz2
cd birdseye-v1.0.3  # or whatever the resultant directory is called
chown -R www-data: storage  # or the appropriate web user on your system
```

You'll need a web server to front it. Apache or Lighttpd are good choices. As the requirements are small and you most likely don't have any other use for a web server on the route server / collector boxes, Lighttpd has a small footprint:

```sh
apt-get install lighttpd
lighty-enable-mod fastcgi
lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php
```

And configure Lighttpd - see [data/configs/lighttpd.conf](https://github.com/inex/birdseye/blob/v1.0.3/data/configs/lighttpd.conf) for an example.

### Install from Source with Composer

If you prefer to install from source with composer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inex/birdseye.git
cd birdseye
composer install
chown -R www-data: storage  # or the appropriate web user on your system
```

## Configuration

I have tried to make configuration as easy as possible while allowing for the fact that we'll typically have *at least* two Bird processes to query on the same server. Explanation is easiest with an example:

Let's say we have a route server providing IPv4 and IPv6 services to two peering LANs on a server called `rs1.inex.ie`.

To query the individual four daemons, we create DNS aliases as follows:

```
rs1-lan1-ipv4.inex.ie IN CNAME rs1.inex.ie
rs1-lan1-ipv6.inex.ie IN CNAME rs1.inex.ie
rs1-lan2-ipv4.inex.ie IN CNAME rs1.inex.ie
rs1-lan2-ipv6.inex.ie IN CNAME rs1.inex.ie
```

The micro-service will extract the first element of the hostname (e.g. `rs1-lan1-ipv4`, see beginning of `bootstrap/app.php`) and look for an environment file in the applications root directory (say `/srv/birdseye`) named as follows for the above examples:

```
rs1-lan1-ipv4.inex.ie -> /srv/birdseye/birdseye-rs1-lan1-ipv4.env
rs1-lan1-ipv6.inex.ie -> /srv/birdseye/birdseye-rs1-lan1-ipv6.env
rs1-lan2-ipv4.inex.ie -> /srv/birdseye/birdseye-rs1-lan2-ipv4.env
rs1-lan2-ipv6.inex.ie -> /srv/birdseye/birdseye-rs1-lan2-ipv6.env
```

To create your env file, just (following the above naming convention):

```
cd /srv/birdseye
cp .env.example birdseye-rs1-lan1-ipv4.env
```

If you do not want to use hostnames and your Bird's Eye install is behind a proxy, you can set the same element as above in the HTTP request header: `X-BIRDSEYE`. See the Varnish example below in the *Serving Behind a Proxy* section.

This example file has sane defaults but you need to edit it and fix the `BIRDC` parameter. In our naming case above (and for `rs1-lan1-ipv4.inex.ie`) we'd set it to:

```
BIRDC="/usr/bin/sudo /srv/birdseye/bin/birdc -4 -s /var/run/bird/rs1-lan1-ipv4.ctl"
```

with the assumption that we've named and located the Bird socket at that location.

If you have a single Bird daemon, you can skip DNS and just do:

```sh
cp .exv.example .env
```

The last thing you need to do is give the `www-data` (or the appropriate web server user) user permission to run the `birdc` script. Edit `/etc/sudoers` and add (example):

```
www-data        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /srv/birdseye/bin/birdc
```

## Built in Looking Glass

This API has an optional built in looking glass which utilises the API internally. This is mildly inefficient as it means a json_encode/json_decode of the same data but it proves the API, keeps us honest and it not a major performance overhead.

To enable it, set the following parameter to true in your configuration file:

```
LOOKING_GLASS_ENABLED=true
```

This will activate the looking glass routes, add a link to the header and make the looking glass available under the base URL `/lg`.

## Disabling Caching on a Per-Request Basis

Caching was implemented to provide a natural rate-limiting mechanism for security and to reduce the load on Bird.

In environments where you already have security in place (e.g. authenticated users on IXP Manager), you may want to disable caching for those requests. You can whitelist a set of IP addresses for this purpose by:

```sh
cp skipcache_ips.php.dist skipcache_ips.php
```

and then editing `skipcache_ips.php` to add your (for example) IXP Manager server's IP address.

If you then tag `?use_cache=0` to API requests, the cache will be avoided. Note that the results from Bird will still be added to the cache so standard requests will still benefit with the freshest data.

## Serving Behind a Proxy

The API requires prefixes (e.g. `192.0.2.0/24`) to be submitted as GET requests and so they need to be URL encoded. Some web servers such as Apache squash these. A sample Apache configuration for proxying Bird's Eye requests is:

```
<VirtualHost 192.0.2.17:80 [2001:db8::17]:80>
    ServerName rc1-lan1-ipv4.example.com
    ServerAlias rc1-lan1-ipv6.example.com

    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

    ProxyPass               /       http://10.8.5.126/     nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse        /       http://10.8.5.126/
</VirtualHost>
```

The code to work out what URL should be used in links [can be seen here](https://github.com/inex/birdseye/blob/master/app/Http/routes.php). In essence:

* if the server is configured for HTTPS, then `https://` is forced.
  * otherwise if `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']` (`X-Forwarded-Proto` in the HTTP request header) is `https`, then `https://` is forced.
  * otherwise it is `http://`
* if `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST']` (`X-Forwarded-Host` in the HTTP request header) is set, then that host is used in the URL. Otherwise it is worked out by PHP in the normal manner.
* if `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_URL']` (`X-Url` in the HTTP request header) is set, then that is tacked onto the hostname as a path / URL prefix.

For example, the live demos above (such as https://www.inex.ie/rc1-cork-ipv4/) is served via a Varnish proxy to an internal host with the following Varish configuration:

```
backend rc1_cork_ipv4 {
    .host = "rc1-ipv4.cork.inex.ie";
    .port = "80";
}

sub vcl_recv {
    ...
    # Birdseye Example Sites
    if (req.url ~ "^/rc1-cork-ipv4/?" ) {
        set req.backend_hint = rc1_cork_ipv4;
        set req.http.x-url = "/rc1-cork-ipv4";
        set req.http.x-birdseye = "rc1-ipv4";
        set req.url = regsub( req.url, "^/rc1-cork-ipv4/?", "/");
        return(pass);
    }
}
```

When a request to Varnish for https://www.inex.ie/rc1-cork-ipv4/ hits the internal host, it sees a HTTP request with with following in PHP's `$_SERVER` array:

```
GET / HTTP/1.0
HTTP_HOST: www.inex.ie
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO: https
HTTP_X_URL: /rc1-cork-ipv4
HTTP_X_BIRDSEYE: rc1-ipv4
```        

Using the above logic, the resolves to a base URL of: `https://www.inex.ie/rc1-cork-ipv4`.

## Nagios Plugins

There are two basic Nagios plugins in the the `bin/` directory which can be downloaded to your Nagios server. As of October 2016, these were in production use at [INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) monitoring 24 Bird daemons and ~350 route server sessions.

The first monitors the basic status of the Bird daemon:

```
# Bird daemon stopped:
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye.php -a http://rc1q-cix-ipv4.inex.ie/api
CRITICAL: Could not query Bird daemon
$ echo $?
2
# Bird daemon running:
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye.php -a http://rc1q-cix-ipv4.inex.ie/api
OK: Bird 1.5.0. Bird's Eye 1.0.0. Router ID 185.1.69.126. Uptime: 0 days. Last Reconfigure: 2016-10-26 11:22:35. 0 BGP sessions up of 0.
$ echo $?
0
```

The second will monitor BGP session states (all or a named protocol):

```
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye-bgp-sessions.php -a http://rc1-cix-ipv4.inex.ie/api
OK: 11/11 BGP sessions up.
$ echo $?
0
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye-bgp-sessions.php -a http://rc1-cix-ipv6.inex.ie/api
CRITICAL: Protocol pb_as42090_vli239_ipv6 - AS42090 down (152 days). 8/9 BGP sessions up.
$ echo $?
2
```

You can disable the Team Cymru ASN to ASN name resolution above (via DNS) by setting the `-n` option:

```
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye-bgp-sessions.php -a http://rc1-cix-ipv6.inex.ie/api -n
CRITICAL: Protocol pb_as42090_vli239_ipv6 - AS42090 down (152 days). 8/9 BGP sessions up.
```

And you can query a specific protocol with:

```
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye-bgp-sessions.php -a http://rc1-cix-ipv4.inex.ie/api -p pb_as43760_vli226_ipv4
OK: BGP session pb_as43760_vli226_ipv4 with AS43760 [INEX-RS Internet Neutral Exchange Association Limited, IE] up (197 days)
```

This also performs prefix limit checking and warning at 80% by default:

```
$ ./nagios-check-birdseye-bgp-sessions.php -a http://birdseye.dev/api
WARNING: BGP session pb_0182_as61337 with AS61337 [ECOM-AS, GB] up (161 days) but prefix limit at 46/50. BGP session pb_0160_as199256 with AS199256 [LTH-AS , IE] up (161 days) but prefix limit at 18/20. 69/73 BGP sessions up.
$ echo $?
1
```

Prefix limit checking can be disabled with a `-l` option.
